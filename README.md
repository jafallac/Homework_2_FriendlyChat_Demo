# Homework_2_FriendlyChat_Demo

For this part, I did the Firebase Web Codelab, which involved doing a FriendlyChat_Demo

The original repository used was this one: //github.com/firebase/friendlychat-web

The tutorial followed was this one: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#0

Firebase Project: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/friendlychat-f63cb/overview

The .mov file is a video of how the app should work.  

The localhost number must be set to a different value each time firebase serve is typed in the Node.js command prompt (5001, 5005, etc.).
